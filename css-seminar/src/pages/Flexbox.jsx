            Flexbox is a very malleable tool that can be used to easily organise items. You may find that sometimes items will not centre. This is may be because the parent has no width or has a smaller set width that means the child has little room to move and therefore cannot be made to centre. Block elements can also sometimes impede flexbox from applying centre to elements. This can be changed with the display property.
