# CSS Seminar

## Aims of the seminar
We receive consistent feedback that students do not feel very comfortable with CSS. This is for a variety of reasons, such as the fact not everybody gets round to it on the precourse, there is no structured delivery of it, and it's an extremely open topic with no one 'right' answer, which can cause people to feel overwhelmed.

This seminar aims to:
- review the syntax with class `.`, id `#` and element selectors
- give a quick overview of essential properties like `margin`, `padding`, etc.
- introduce tools for dealing with layout such as Flexbox and Grid
- introduce helpful resources like CSS tricks that have cheatsheets
- introduce mobile-first design 
- show how to use media queries
- show a few ways to centre things as this is always tricky! This includes Flexbox, Grid, `margin` with `auto` and 0, and use of the `position` property
- talk about how `block`, `inline-block` and `inline` elements differ. My go-to for explaining this has [always been this fab webpage](https://www.samanthaming.com/pictorials/css-inline-vs-inlineblock-vs-block/#explained-in-non-dev-terms)
- introduce CSS libraries e.g. Bootstrap, tachyons, MUI, etc.

## How this seminar is delivered
CSS is best learned with practice so this seminar is more like a workshop. Students will be provided with the repo you are working from to work along with you. You may wish to either:
- give a challenge e.g. centre the div, then talk through how it could be achieved
- allow students to follow along
